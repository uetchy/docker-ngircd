#
# This is a sample configuration file for the ngIRCd IRC daemon, which must
# be customized to the local preferences and needs.
#
# Comments are started with "#" or ";".
#
# A lot of configuration options in this file start with a ";". You have
# to remove the ";" in front of each variable to actually set a value!
# The disabled variables are shown with example values for completeness only
# and the daemon is using compiled-in default settings.
#
# Use "ngircd --configtest" (see manual page ngircd(8)) to validate that the
# server interprets the configuration file as expected!
#
# Please see ngircd.conf(5) for a complete list of configuration options
# and their descriptions.
#
# The original can be found at:
# /usr/share/doc/ngircd/examples/sample-ngircd.conf.gz

[Global]
	# The [Global] section of this file is used to define the main
	# configuration of the server, like the server name and the ports
	# on which the server should be listening.
	# These settings depend on your personal preferences, so you should
	# make sure that they correspond to your installation and setup!

	# Server name in the IRC network, must contain at least one dot
	# (".") and be unique in the IRC network. Required!
	Name = {{NGIRCD_NAME}}

	# Information about the server and the administrator, used by the
	# ADMIN command. Not required by server but by RFC!
	AdminInfo1 = Your Priorities Users
	AdminInfo2 = Citizens Foundation
	AdminEMail = citizens@citizens.is

	# Info text of the server. This will be shown by WHOIS and
	# LINKS requests for example.
	Info = {{NGIRCD_INFO}}

	# Comma separated list of IP addresses on which the server should
	# listen. Default values are:
	# "0.0.0.0" or (if compiled with IPv6 support) "::,0.0.0.0"
	# so the server listens on all IP addresses of the system by default.
	;Listen = 127.0.0.1,192.168.0.1

	# Text file with the "message of the day" (MOTD). This message will
	# be shown to all users connecting to the server:
	;MotdFile = /etc/ngircd/ngircd.motd

	# A simple Phrase (<256 chars) if you don't want to use a motd file.
	MotdPhrase = {{NGIRCD_MOTD_PHRASE}}

	# Global password for all users needed to connect to the server.
	# (Default: not set)
	Password = {{NGIRCD_PASSWORD}}

	# This tells ngIRCd to write its current process ID to a file.
	# Note that the pidfile is written AFTER chroot and switching the
	# user ID, e.g. the directory the pidfile resides in must be
	# writable by the ngIRCd user and exist in the chroot directory.
	# Keep this setting in sync with PIDFILE in /etc/init.d/ngircd
	PidFile = /var/run/ngircd/ngircd.pid

	# Ports on which the server should listen. There may be more than
	# one port, separated with ",". (Default: 6667)
	;Ports = 6667

	# Group ID under which the ngIRCd should run; you can use the name
	# of the group or the numerical ID. ATTENTION: For this to work the
	# server must have been started with root privileges!
	# Keep this setting in sync with DAEMONUSER in /etc/init.d/ngircd
	ServerGID = irc

	# User ID under which the server should run; you can use the name
	# of the user or the numerical ID. ATTENTION: For this to work the
	# server must have been started with root privileges! In addition,
	# the configuration and MOTD files must be readable by this user,
	# otherwise RESTART and REHASH won't work!
	# Keep this setting in sync with DAEMONUSER in /etc/init.d/ngircd
	ServerUID = irc

[Limits]
	# Define some limits and timeouts for this ngIRCd instance. Default
	# values should be safe, but it is wise to double-check :-)

	# The server tries every <ConnectRetry> seconds to establish a link
	# to not yet (or no longer) connected servers.
	ConnectRetry = 60

	# Maximum number of simultaneous in- and outbound connections the
	# server is allowed to accept (0: unlimited):
	MaxConnections = 0

	# Maximum number of simultaneous connections from a single IP address
	# the server will accept (0: unlimited):
	MaxConnectionsIP = 0

	# Maximum number of channels a user can be member of (0: no limit):
	MaxJoins = 0

	# Maximum length of an user nick name (Default: 9, as in RFC 2812).
	# Please note that all servers in an IRC network MUST use the same
	# maximum nick name length!
	MaxNickLength = 72

	# After <PingTimeout> seconds of inactivity the server will send a
	# PING to the peer to test whether it is alive or not.
	PingTimeout = 120

	# If a client fails to answer a PING with a PONG within <PongTimeout>
	# seconds, it will be disconnected by the server.
	PongTimeout = 20

[Options]
	# Optional features and configuration options to further tweak the
	# behavior of ngIRCd. If you want to get started quickly, you most
	# probably don't have to make changes here -- they are all optional.

	# Are remote IRC operators allowed to control this server, e.g.
	# use commands like CONNECT, SQUIT, DIE, ...?
	;AllowRemoteOper = no

	# A directory to chroot in when everything is initialized. It
	# doesn't need to be populated if ngIRCd is compiled as a static
	# binary. By default ngIRCd won't use the chroot() feature.
	# ATTENTION: For this to work the server must have been started
	# with root privileges!
	;ChrootDir = /var/empty

	# Set this hostname for every client instead of the real one.
	# Please note: don't use the percentage sign ("%"), it is reserved for
	# future extensions!
	;CloakHost = cloaked.host

	# Use this hostname for hostname cloaking on clients that have the
	# user mode "+x" set, instead of the name of the server.
	# Please note: don't use the percentage sign ("%"), it is reserved for
	# future extensions!
	;CloakHostModeX = cloaked.user

	# Set every clients' user name to their nick name
	;CloakUserToNick = yes

	# Try to connect to other IRC servers using IPv4 and IPv6, if possible.
	;ConnectIPv6 = yes
	;ConnectIPv4 = yes

	# Do any DNS lookups when a client connects to the server.
	DNS = no

	# Do IDENT lookups if ngIRCd has been compiled with support for it.
	# Users identified using IDENT are registered without the "~" character
	# prepended to their user name.
	# Note: The Debian package was compiled without ident support.
	;Ident = yes

	# Enhance user privacy slightly (useful for IRC server on TOR or I2P)
	# by censoring some information like idle time, logon time, etc.
	MorePrivacy = yes

	# Normally ngIRCd doesn't send any messages to a client until it is
	# registered. Enable this option to let the daemon send "NOTICE AUTH"
	# messages to clients while connecting.
	NoticeAuth = yes

	# Should IRC Operators be allowed to use the MODE command even if
	# they are not(!) channel-operators?
	OperCanUseMode = yes

	# Mask IRC Operator mode requests as if they were coming from the
	# server? (This is a compatibility hack for ircd-irc2 servers)
	;OperServerMode = no

	# Use PAM if ngIRCd has been compiled with support for it.
	# Users identified using PAM are registered without the "~" character
	# prepended to their user name.
	# Note: The Debian package was compiled without PAM support.
	;PAM = yes

	# When PAM is enabled, all clients are required to be authenticated
	# using PAM; connecting to the server without successful PAM
	# authentication isn't possible.
	# If this option is set, clients not sending a password are still
	# allowed to connect: they won't become "identified" and keep the "~"
	# character prepended to their supplied user name.
	# Please note: To make some use of this behavior, it most probably
	# isn't useful to enable "Ident", "PAM" and "PAMIsOptional" at the
	# same time, because you wouldn't be able to distinguish between
	# Ident'ified and PAM-authenticated users: both don't have a "~"
	# character prepended to their respective user names!
	;PAMIsOptional = no

	# Allow Pre-Defined Channels only (see Section [Channels])
	;PredefChannelsOnly = no

	# Let ngIRCd send an "authentication PING" when a new client connects,
	# and register this client only after receiving the corresponding
	# "PONG" reply.
	;RequireAuthPing = no

	# Silently drop all incoming CTCP requests.
	ScrubCTCP = no

	# Syslog "facility" to which ngIRCd should send log messages.
	# Possible values are system dependent, but most probably auth, daemon,
	# user and local1 through local7 are possible values; see syslog(3).
	# Default is "local5" for historical reasons, you probably want to
	# change this to "daemon", for example.
	SyslogFacility = local1

	# Password required for using the WEBIRC command used by some
	# Web-to-IRC gateways. If not set/empty, the WEBIRC command can't
	# be used. (Default: not set)
	;WebircPassword = xyz

[SSL]
	# SSL-related configuration options.

	# SSL Server Key Certificate
	;CertFile = /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt

	# Diffie-Hellman parameters
	;DHFile = /etc/ngircd/dhparams.pem

	# SSL Server Key
	;KeyFile = /etc/ssl/private/server.key

	# password to decrypt SSLKeyFile (OpenSSL only)
	# Note that this Debian package was linked against GnuTLS so this
	# option has no effect.
	;KeyFilePassword = secret

	# Additional Listen Ports that expect SSL/TLS encrypted connections
	;Ports = {{NGIRCD_SSL_PORT}}

[Operator]
	# [Operator] sections are used to define IRC Operators. There may be
	# more than one [Operator] block, one for each local operator.

	# ID of the operator (may be different of the nick name)
	;Name = TheOper

	# Password of the IRC operator
	;Password = ThePwd

	# Optional Mask from which /OPER will be accepted
	;Mask = *!ident@somewhere.example.com

[Channel]
	# Pre-defined channels can be configured in [Channel] sections.
	# Such channels are created by the server when starting up and even
	# persist when there are no more members left.
	# Persistent channels are marked with the mode 'P', which can be set
	# and unset by IRC operators like other modes on the fly.
	# There may be more than one [Channel] block, one for each channel.

	# Name of the channel
	;Name = #ngircd

	# Topic for this channel
	;Topic = Our ngircd testing channel

	# Initial channel modes
	;Modes = tnk

	# initial channel password (mode k)
	;Key = Secret

	# Key file, syntax for each line: "<user>:<nick>:<key>".
	# Default: none.
	;KeyFile = /etc/ngircd/#chan.key

	# maximum users per channel (mode l)
	MaxUsers = 10000
